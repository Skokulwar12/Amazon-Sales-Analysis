# Amazon-Sales-Analysis

SQL analysis of Amazon sales to unveil trends, preferences, and profitability insights to drive operational optimization and profitability.
 
INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the Amazon Sales Analysis project! Here, we delve into Amazon's sales data to extract 
insights and trends vital for optimizing sales strategies, understanding customer behaviour, and 
improving business operations. Through advanced SQL techniques, we'll analyze data to uncover 
correlations, identify emerging trends, and provide predictive insights. Our focus areas encompass 
data analysis, sales strategies, customer behaviour, SQL techniques, optimization, insights, trends, 
and business operations, aiming to empower stakeholders with actionable intelligence for informed 
decision-making and sustained growth.


DATASET OVERVIEW

The dataset used in this project consists of Approximately 10,000 rows of data, representing Amazon 
sales transactions. Along with the sales data, the dataset includes information about customers, 
products, orders, returns and sellers. Before analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing to handle 
missing values and ensure data quality, a crucial step in data analysis workflows. This preprocessing 
stage ensures the integrity and reliability of our findings, enabling us to draw accurate insights and 
make informed decisions based on the data.
